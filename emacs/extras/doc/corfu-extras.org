This manual describes the features and customization options for the Emacs Lisp file =corfu-extras.el=.

* Overview
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:overview
:END:

=corfu-extras.el= provides extensions for the =corfu= package, which offers a Completion Overlay Region FUnctionality for Emacs. These extensions focus on controlling Corfu's activation in the minibuffer and integrating it with other completion UIs like =consult=.

The main features include:

+ Conditional activation of =corfu-mode= in the minibuffer, avoiding conflicts with =vertico=.
+ A command to transfer the current Corfu completion session to the minibuffer using =consult-completion-in-region=.

* Configuration Functions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:configuration-functions
:END:

These functions are intended for use in Emacs configuration, typically added to hooks.

** Enable Corfu Always in Minibuffer (Conditionally)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:corfu-extras-enable-always-in-minibuffer
:END:

#+findex: corfu-extras-enable-always-in-minibuffer
The function ~corfu-extras-enable-always-in-minibuffer~ is designed to be added to ~minibuffer-setup-hook~. It enables =corfu-mode= within the minibuffer *only if* the =vertico= package's input state variable (=vertico--input=) is not bound and true.

This ensures that Corfu provides completion assistance in minibuffer prompts like =eval-expression= or =shell-command=, but automatically disables itself when Vertico is active (e.g., during =find-file= or =M-x=), preventing conflicts between the two completion UIs.

* Commands
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:commands
:END:

=corfu-extras.el= provides the following interactive command:

** Move Corfu Completion to Minibuffer
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:corfu-extras-move-to-minibuffer
:END:

#+findex: corfu-extras-move-to-minibuffer
The command ~corfu-extras-move-to-minibuffer~ transfers the current in-buffer Corfu completion session to the minibuffer using =consult-completion-in-region= (from the =consult= package). This allows the user to leverage Consult's features (like preview and narrowing) for the completion candidates initially presented by Corfu.

This command is automatically added to the ~corfu-continue-commands~ list, meaning it can typically be invoked while the Corfu popup is active using a key binding associated with continuing completion (often =M-n= or similar, depending on the user's setup).

* Indices
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:indices
:END:

** Function index
:PROPERTIES:
:INDEX: fn
:CUSTOM_ID: h:function-index
:END:

** Variable index
:PROPERTIES:
:INDEX: vr
:CUSTOM_ID: h:variable-index
:END:
