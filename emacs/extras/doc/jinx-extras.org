This manual describes the features and customization options for the Emacs Lisp file =jinx-extras.el=.

* Overview
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:overview
:END:

=jinx-extras.el= provides extensions for the =jinx= package, which offers interactive spell checking using external checkers like Hunspell or Aspell. These extensions focus on integrating Jinx corrections with Emacs' abbreviation system and providing language toggling.

The main features include:

+ Automatically adding corrected misspellings as text-mode abbreviations.
+ A command to quickly toggle between configured Jinx languages (e.g., English and Spanish).

* Enhanced Functionality
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:enhanced-functionality
:END:

** Add Corrections as Abbreviations
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:jinx-extras--add-to-abbrev
:END:

#+findex: jinx-extras--add-to-abbrev
The internal function ~jinx-extras--add-to-abbrev~ is added as `:before` advice to the Jinx internal function ~jinx--correct-replace~.

When the user selects a correction for a misspelled word using Jinx:
1. This advice function runs *before* the replacement happens.
2. It extracts the original misspelled word from the Jinx overlay.
3. It takes the selected correction (WORD) passed to ~jinx--correct-replace~.
4. It defines a new abbreviation in the =text-mode-abbrev-table= where the misspelled word expands to the corrected word, using =define-abbrev=.
5. It messages the user about the abbreviation being added.
6. Control then passes to the original ~jinx--correct-replace~ function to perform the actual replacement in the buffer.

This automatically builds up a list of abbreviations for common typos corrected via Jinx, potentially speeding up future writing.

* Commands
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:commands
:END:

=jinx-extras.el= provides the following interactive command:

** Toggle Jinx Languages
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:jinx-extras-toggle-languages
:END:

#+findex: jinx-extras-toggle-languages
The command ~jinx-extras-toggle-languages~ provides a quick way to switch between two pre-configured languages for Jinx spell checking. It checks the current value of ~jinx-languages~:
- If it's currently "en" (English), it switches to "es" (Spanish).
- If it's currently "es", it switches back to "en".

This assumes the user primarily switches between English and Spanish. For more languages or different primary languages, this command would need modification. It calls the standard ~jinx-languages~ function to apply the change.

* Indices
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:indices

** Function index
:PROPERTIES:
:INDEX: fn
:CUSTOM_ID: h:function-index

** Variable index
