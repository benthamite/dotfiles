Hi $1,

How are you doing? I’d be glad to host you, but please bear in mind that I’ll be super busy with a work project I'm finishing, so I don’t expect us to be able to interact much. If that is okay with you, you are very welcome to stay with me. My house is quite big and you’ll have your own room with a private bathroom and shower. The place is in Barracas, close to Parque Lezama, in the Southern part of Buenos Aires.

All the best,

Pablo
