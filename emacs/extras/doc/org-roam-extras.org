This manual describes the features and customization options for the Emacs Lisp file =org-roam-extras.el=.

* Overview
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:overview
:END:

=org-roam-extras.el= provides extensions for the =org-roam= package, a note-taking tool for Emacs inspired by Zettelkasten principles. These extensions focus on managing note creation, finding nodes, handling backlinks, and integrating with other parts of the user's configuration.

The main features include:

- Configurable lists for excluding specific directories and files from Org Roam's database.
- A command to create new Org Roam notes, prompting for type (generic, person, project-specific) to determine directory and initial tags.
- A command to convert the current Org heading and its content into a new Org Roam note file.
- An enhanced node-finding command that ensures the buffer is widened before searching.
- A specialized node-finding command (=org-roam-extras-node-find-special=) that filters nodes based on priority, TODO state, absence of dates, and optional tags/directories, presenting them sorted by priority.
- Functions to calculate and display the backlink count for the current node, potentially integrating with modeline packages like =doom-modeline=.
- Automatic display of the Org Roam backlink buffer when opening a file with backlinks (configurable).
- A helper function to query Org Roam nodes tagged as "person".
- A utility function to list Org Roam files modified within a specified number of days.
- A helper function to remove file-level properties ("ROAM_REFS", "ID") during Org Capture finalization for specific templates.
- An enhanced command to jump to an Org ID, ensuring the buffer is widened first.
- A patch to potentially mitigate database locking issues by adding a small delay before querying.

* User Options
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:user-options
:END:

** ~org-roam-extras-excluded-dirs~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:org-roam-extras-excluded-dirs
:END:

#+vindex: org-roam-extras-excluded-dirs
A list of directory paths (strings) that should be excluded when Org Roam scans for notes (used via the standard =org-roam-file-exclude-regexp=).

** ~org-roam-extras-excluded-files~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:org-roam-extras-excluded-files
:END:

#+vindex: org-roam-extras-excluded-files
A list of filenames or patterns (strings) that should be excluded when Org Roam scans for notes (used via =org-roam-file-exclude-regexp=).

** ~org-roam-extras-auto-show-backlink-buffer~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:org-roam-extras-auto-show-backlink-buffer
:END:

#+vindex: org-roam-extras-auto-show-backlink-buffer
If non-nil, the Org Roam buffer (=org-roam-buffer=) will be automatically displayed when a file containing backlinks is opened (via =org-roam-extras-show-backlink-buffer= hooked to =find-file-hook=). Default is nil.

* Commands
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:commands
:END:

=org-roam-extras.el= provides the following interactive commands:

** Create New Note
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:org-roam-extras-new-note
:END:

#+findex: org-roam-extras-new-note
The command ~org-roam-extras-new-note~ creates a new Org Roam note. It prompts the user to select a note type ("generic", "person", "Borges", "tango", "tlon-notes"). Based on the type, it determines the target directory (e.g., =paths-dir-notes=, =paths-dir-people=) and initial tags. It then prompts for the note name (title), creates the file using a slugified version of the name, inserts the =#+title:= and an initial heading, sets the tags, creates an Org ID, narrows to the new entry, and places point at the end.

** Convert Heading to Note
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:org-roam-extras-convert-heading-to-note
:END:

#+findex: org-roam-extras-convert-heading-to-note
The command ~org-roam-extras-convert-heading-to-note~ extracts the current Org heading and its content (including subheadings), prompts for a new note name (defaulting to the current heading title), creates a new Org Roam file in the *current* directory with that name, pastes the extracted content into the new file, sets the =#+title:=, and adjusts the top-level heading in the new file. The original heading and content are killed from the source buffer.

** Find Node (Enhanced)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:org-roam-extras-node-find
:END:

#+findex: org-roam-extras-node-find
The command ~org-roam-extras-node-find~ acts like =org-roam-node-find= but ensures the buffer is widened and all headings are visible before invoking the node finder. It also recenters the buffer after jumping.

** Find Special Node (Filtered & Sorted)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:org-roam-extras-node-find-special
:END:

#+findex: org-roam-extras-node-find-special
The command ~org-roam-extras-node-find-special~ provides a filtered and sorted list of Org Roam nodes for selection via =consult--read=. It selects nodes that:
- Have a priority (=#+priority:=).
- Have either no TODO state or the state "TODO".
- Do *not* have a SCHEDULED or DEADLINE timestamp.
It can optionally filter further by tag or directory (prompting the user if called with =t= or a prefix arg, or using provided :tag/:dir specifier). The results are presented sorted by priority (ascending, A->C) and jumping to the selected node uses =org-id-goto=.

** Select Tag
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:org-roam-extras-node-select-tag
:END:

#+findex: org-roam-extras-node-select-tag
The command ~org-roam-extras-node-select-tag~ prompts the user (using =consult--read=) to select a tag from the list of all tags present in the Org Roam database. Returns the selected tag string. Used by =org-roam-extras-node-find-special=.

** Go to ID (Enhanced)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:org-roam-extras-id-goto
:END:

#+findex: org-roam-extras-id-goto
The command ~org-roam-extras-id-goto~ takes an Org ID and jumps to its location using =org-roam-id-open=. It ensures the buffer is widened both before and after the jump, which can be helpful if the target is in a currently narrowed buffer.

* Configuration Functions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:configuration-functions-roam
:END:

** Backlink Count Update
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:backlink-count-update
:END:

#+findex: org-roam-extras-update-backlink-count
~org-roam-extras-update-backlink-count~: Calculates the number of backlinks for the current node ID and stores it in the buffer-local variable =org-roam-extras-current-backlink-count=.

#+findex: org-roam-extras-update-modeline
~org-roam-extras-update-modeline~: Calls =org-roam-extras-update-backlink-count= and then forces a modeline update (specifically calling =doom-modeline-update-buffer-file-name=). Intended to be hooked (e.g., to =buffer-list-update-hook=) to keep the modeline backlink count fresh.

** Show Backlink Buffer Automatically
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:show-backlink-buffer-auto
:END:

#+findex: org-roam-extras-show-backlink-buffer
~org-roam-extras-show-backlink-buffer~: Intended for =find-file-hook=. If =org-roam-extras-auto-show-backlink-buffer= is non-nil and the Org Roam buffer isn't already visible, it displays the Org Roam buffer and refreshes its content.

** Capture Hook Function
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:capture-hook
:END:

#+findex: org-roam-extras-remove-file-level-properties
~org-roam-extras-remove-file-level-properties~: Intended for =org-capture-before-finalize-hook=. If the capture template key is "r", it removes any file-level "ID" and "ROAM_REFS" properties from the captured entry and ensures the first heading gets an ID.

* Utility Functions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:utility-functions-roam
:END:

- ~org-roam-extras-get-note-properties~: Helper for =org-roam-extras-new-note=; prompts for note type and returns =(list DIR TAGS)=.
- ~org-roam-extras-create-file-for-note~: Helper for =org-roam-extras-new-note=; creates the file with slugified name in the target directory.
- ~org-roam-extras-backlink-count~: Returns the number of backlinks for the node ID at point.
- ~org-roam-extras-get-people~: Queries the database for nodes in the "people" directory with level 1 headings, returning a list of =(title id)= pairs.
- ~org-roam-extras-recent~: Returns a list of Org Roam files modified within the last DAYS.

* Patched Functions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:patched-functions-roam
:END:

** ~org-roam-db-query~ Patch
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:org-roam-db-query-patch
:END:

The function ~org-roam-db-query~ is patched using =el-patch= to insert a very small delay (=sleep-for 0.01=) before executing the database query. This is likely an attempt to mitigate potential SQLite database locking issues that can occur with rapid queries, although its effectiveness might vary.

* Indices
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:indices
:END:

** Function index
:PROPERTIES:
:INDEX: fn
:CUSTOM_ID: h:function-index
:END:

** Variable index
:PROPERTIES:
:INDEX: vr
:CUSTOM_ID: h:variable-index
:END:
