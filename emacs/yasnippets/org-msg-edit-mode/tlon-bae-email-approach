Our rate is USD 0.15 per word in the original English version. We can translate 2,500 words per weekday starting the day we finalize the agreement, provided we are not working on another project (if we are working on another project, we will let you know in advance).

Some reasons you may want to hire us:

- I will be the primary translator, and I have considerable experience as a professional translator, especially of works in philosophy. E.g., I translated John Locke's /Second Treatise on Civil Government/.
- I've been part of the EA community from the beginning and I'm pretty familiar with the EA literature. Because of this, I have (I think) good intuitions on how to translate various technical or idiosyncratic expressions.
- Our process involves a mixture of human and machine translation (we use a combination of DeepL and GPT-4), which produces a translation of significantly higher quality than one by either humans or machines alone.
- We pay considerable attention to translating the relevant terminology consistently and have a glossary of over 800 terms and expressions. 
- Every work we translate can be optionally published on ~altruismoeficaz.net~, the website where we will publish the initial batch of translations funded by Open Philanthropy. I expect this website to become the most popular site of EA content in the Spanish community, occupying roughly the place the EA Forum has in English, and our long-term goal is to turn this website into a proper discussion forum. (Note that the site hasn't launched yet.)
- We also offer audio narrations, at a rate of USD 0.025 per word. The translations are narrated by [[https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Wullich][Martin Wullich]], a well-known and respected voice actor from Argentina. Here is a recording of Martin narrating Nick Bostrom's '[[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qKU387yBM--LuAxJmE4rpRvHUyiCStg-&usp=drive_fs][Astronomical waste]]'.
