  "Reload PACKAGE's features.
If ALLP is non-nil (interactively, with prefix), load all of its
features; otherwise only load ones that were already loaded.

This is useful to reload a package after upgrading it.  Since a
package may provide multiple features, to reload it properly
would require either restarting Emacs or manually unloading and
reloading each loaded feature.  This automates that process.

Note that this unloads all of the package's symbols before
reloading.  Any data stored in those symbols will be lost, so if
the package would normally save that data, e.g. when a mode is
deactivated or when Emacs exits, the user should do so before
using this command."
