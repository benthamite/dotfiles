This manual describes the features and customization options for the Emacs Lisp file =files-extras.el=.

* Overview
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:overview
:END:

=files-extras.el= provides a wide range of extensions for general file and buffer manipulation in Emacs. It enhances built-in commands, adds new convenience functions, integrates with external tools (like =trash=, =ocrmypdf=), and offers custom transient menus.

The main features include:

- **File Deletion:** Overrides =system-move-file-to-trash= to use the external =trash= utility (macOS) for "Put Back" functionality.
- **Buffer Management:** Commands to save/revert, bury the scratch buffer instead of killing, create new empty buffers, switch to alternate buffers, kill buffers smartly, and revert all file buffers.
- **File/Path Utilities:** Get newest file in a directory (excluding macOS clutter), switch to most recent buffer in a specific mode, set buffer-local keys, get file stem, check if point is on last line, copy current path, copy file contents.
- **External Tools Integration:**
  + OCR PDF files using =ocrmypdf=.
  + Download and install "Bypass Paywalls" browser extensions.
- **File Recovery:** Command to recover all auto-saved files after a crash, alert when auto-save data is detected for the current file.
- **Diffing:** Command to diff the current buffer against its saved file.
- **Directory Locals:** Option to walk =.dir-locals.el= upward for chained evaluation (currently commented out).
- **Image Conversion:** Command to convert the current image buffer to PDF using =convert=.
- **Package Management:** Commands to open Elpaca package files or specific "extras" files.
- **Transient Menus:** Dispatchers for quickly opening common configuration files, project files, and package files.
- **Misc:** DWIM copy command, remove extra blank lines, open Grammarly editor.
