This manual describes the features and customization options for the Emacs Lisp file =ebib-extras.el=.

* Overview
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:overview
:END:

=ebib-extras.el= provides extensions for =ebib=, the Emacs BibTeX database manager. These extensions enhance file handling, entry processing, searching, sorting, interaction with external tools (like Sci-Hub, Annas Archive, Zotero), and provide various convenience commands.

The main features include:

+ Commands to open Ebib, reload databases without confirmation, and manage window layout.
+ Functions to retrieve specific fields (ISBN, file paths, language) from entries.
+ Commands to open associated files (PDF, HTML, Markdown, SRT, VTT, media) internally or externally.
+ A DWIM command to open the most relevant associated file.
+ Commands to rename attached files based on the entry key and validate existing file names.
+ Functions for finding and renaming files with invalid names (based on key lookup).
+ A command to process entries: generate keys, set language, download/attach files, generate abstracts.
+ Commands to attach files (newest download, specific file, generated from URL/DOI/ISBN).
+ Integration with external tools:
  + Annas Archive and Sci-Hub for downloading PDFs based on ISBN/DOI.
  + Zotero (via =zotra-extras=) for fetching abstracts and field values.
  + =yt-dlp= for downloading videos/subtitles.
  + =exiftool= for setting PDF metadata.
  + =ocrmypdf= for OCRing attached PDFs.
+ Commands to search for entries on various external websites (Library Genesis, Amazon, WorldCat, Google Scholar, etc.).
+ Commands to set entry ratings and notes.
+ Enhanced navigation commands (next/previous entry).
+ Integration with =citar= to open associated notes.
+ Automatic saving and reloading mechanisms for specific database files.
+ Functions for sorting the Ebib index buffer by different criteria (Timestamp, Author, Title).
+ A command to duplicate the current entry.
