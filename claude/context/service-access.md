# Service access tools

Local tools for external services. Prefer them over ad-hoc API calls or
browser automation; each already carries the right account and auth.

| Service | Tool |
|---|---|
| Paper PDFs (DOI, URL, arXiv, title; Anna's Archive, LibGen, open access) | `bin/paper-fetch` |
| Gmail | `claude/bin/gmail.py` |
| Google Sheets | `claude/bin/sheets.py` |
| Slack | `claude/bin/slack.py` |
| Google Calendar | `gcalcli-epoch` (canonical Epoch OAuth grant; shared personal calendars) |
| Google Docs / Drive | `gdoc` |
| GitHub | `gh` |

Relative paths are under the dotfiles root, `~/My Drive/dotfiles/`. For
Google account and auth details, read `google-services.md` in this
directory.

## Paper PDFs

`paper-fetch get IDENT` is the single implementation for obtaining a paper PDF:
open-access routes first (Unpaywall, OpenAlex, arXiv, publisher page), then
LibGen -> Anna's Archive member fast download, then Anna's Archive SciDB, then a
browser job for hosts that only answer a real browser (PhilPapers, PhilArchive,
Anna's Archive HTML). It verifies that the file's text matches the requested
title or DOI before reporting `ok`. The `download-paper` skill drives it,
including the browser fallback; `add-bib-entry` uses it for attachments. Shared
logic lives in `lib/python/paper_fetch.py`; do not add another Anna's Archive
client. The tool reads the Anna's Archive key itself (see `secrets.md`) and
needs an active membership: `status: not-member` means the membership lapsed.

## Google Drive original files

`gdoc download FILE_ID --account personal --output NEW_PATH` downloads the original
bytes of a PDF or other stored file. Use the appropriate account from
`google-services.md`. It refuses existing destinations and native Google Workspace
files; `gdoc export` remains the command for converting native documents.

The canonical `bin/gdoc` launcher extends the installed uv-managed CLI with
`claude/bin/gdoc_download.py`, reusing its parser, account selection, authentication,
and command allowlist. Existing commands are delegated unchanged. Downloads check
Drive permission, size, and available MD5 metadata before installing the file. The
installed package is not patched. If upstream adds `download`, the extension stops
with an explicit retirement message rather than shadowing that implementation.

## Browser-only flows

For Codex automation that depends on an existing Chrome session, use the
installed Chrome plugin through its `control-chrome` skill and browser client.
Verify the connection with a read-only tab listing before navigating. A failed
generic Playwright or guessed CDP connection does not show that Chrome control
is unavailable.

`chrome-profile-open <alias> URL` is only a launcher for a page the user wants
opened manually. It activates Chrome and can steal focus. Never use it,
AppleScript, System Events, screenshots, or coordinate clicking as a fallback
for Codex browser automation. If the Chrome plugin cannot connect after its
documented checks, fail closed and report the connection problem.

Configure launcher aliases with `chrome-profile-open --setup <alias>`.
Project wrappers may call the launcher when manual opening is the requested
action, for example `trajectory-open URL` for Trajectory/CR pages.
