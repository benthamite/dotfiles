This manual describes the features and customization options for the Emacs Lisp file =org-gcal-extras.el=.

* Overview
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:overview
:END:

=org-gcal-extras.el= provides extensions for the =org-gcal= package, which synchronizes Org mode entries with Google Calendar events. These extensions add commands for opening events in the Google Calendar web interface and provide a transient menu for common =org-gcal= operations. It also includes patches to modify the default behavior of how event times and descriptions are handled during synchronization.

The main features include:

- A command to open the Google Calendar event corresponding to the Org entry at point in a web browser.
- A transient menu (=org-gcal-extras-menu=) for quick access to fetch, sync, post, open, delete, and setup commands.
- Patches to modify how =org-gcal= reads timestamps (preferring DEADLINE over SCHEDULED) and how it updates Org entries (inserting description as body text, using DEADLINE instead of SCHEDULED).

* Commands
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:commands
:END:

=org-gcal-extras.el= provides the following interactive commands:

** Open Event in Google Calendar
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:org-gcal-extras-open-at-point
:END:

#+findex: org-gcal-extras-open-at-point
The command ~org-gcal-extras-open-at-point~ retrieves the Google Calendar event ID stored in the "entry-id" property of the Org heading at point. It then constructs the corresponding Google Calendar edit URL and opens it in the default web browser using =browse-url=. If no "entry-id" property is found, it signals a user error.

** Org Gcal Extras Menu
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:org-gcal-extras-menu
:END:

#+findex: org-gcal-extras-menu
The command ~org-gcal-extras-menu~ displays a transient menu (using the =transient= package) that provides quick access to common =org-gcal= commands grouped logically:
- *Fetch:* Fetch all (=org-gcal-fetch=), Fetch buffer (=org-gcal-fetch-buffer=).
- *Sync:* Sync all (=org-gcal-sync=), Sync buffer (=org-gcal-sync-buffer=).
- *Act:* Post entry at point (=org-gcal-post-at-point=), Open event at point in browser (=org-gcal-extras-open-at-point=), Delete event at point (=org-gcal-delete-at-point=).
- *Setup:* Unlock sync (=org-gcal--sync-unlock=), Clear token (=org-gcal-sync-tokens-clear=), Toggle debug (=org-gcal-toggle-debug=), Reload secret (=org-gcal-reload-client-id-secret=).

* Patched Functions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:patched-functions-org-gcal
:END:

=org-gcal-extras.el= modifies core =org-gcal= functions using =el-patch=:

** ~org-gcal--get-time-and-desc~ Patch
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:org-gcal--get-time-and-desc-patch
:END:

The internal function ~org-gcal--get-time-and-desc~ is patched to change the preference for reading timestamps from Org entries. The original function prefers the =SCHEDULED= property. The patched version prefers the =DEADLINE= property over =SCHEDULED= when determining the start/end times for an event to be synced *to* Google Calendar. It still falls back to timestamps found within the =:org-gcal:= drawer if neither property exists.

** ~org-gcal--update-entry~ Patch
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:org-gcal--update-entry-patch
:END:

The internal function ~org-gcal--update-entry~ is patched to modify how Google Calendar event details are written back into an Org entry during synchronization:
- It removes the creation of the =:ORG-GCAL:= drawer entirely.
- Instead of putting the event description inside the drawer, it inserts the description directly into the body of the Org heading.
- It sets the event's date/time using the =DEADLINE= property instead of the =SCHEDULED= property. If a =DEADLINE= already exists, it updates it; otherwise, it creates a new =DEADLINE=.

These patches aim to integrate Google Calendar events more naturally into an Org workflow that primarily uses deadlines and keeps descriptive text within the main heading body.

* Indices

** Function index
:PROPERTIES:

:CUSTOM_ID: h:function-index
