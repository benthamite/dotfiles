This manual describes the features and customization options for the Emacs Lisp file =forge-extras.el=.

* Overview
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:overview
:END:

=forge-extras.el= provides extensions for the =forge= package, which integrates Emacs with Git forges like GitHub and GitLab. These extensions focus on notification handling, issue/PR management, repository tracking, and navigating topic discussions.

The main features include:

+ Storing Org links for multiple selected commits in =magit-status= buffers.
+ A command to browse the GitHub notification inbox.
+ A DWIM (Do What I Mean) command to toggle the state (open/closed) of the issue/PR at point.
+ Automatic pulling of Forge notifications when the GitHub notification count (from =doom-modeline=) changes.
+ Synchronization of read status between Forge and GitHub by briefly opening the issue/PR URL in Safari (macOS specific).
+ Commands to track Git repositories in Forge, pulling all topics.
+ Commands to navigate between posts (messages) within a Forge topic buffer.
+ A command to copy the body of the message at point to the kill ring.

* Commands
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:commands
:END:

=forge-extras.el= provides the following interactive commands:

** Store Org Links for Multiple Commits
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:forge-extras-orgit-store-link
:END:

#+findex: forge-extras-orgit-store-link
The command ~forge-extras-orgit-store-link~ enhances the standard =org-store-link= functionality within Magit/Forge contexts.
- If multiple commit sections are selected in a Magit buffer, it iterates through them and calls =org-store-link= for each, effectively storing links to all selected commits.
- If no region is active or the region doesn't contain commits, it determines the Forge topic (issue or pull request) at point, visits it, and then calls =org-store-link= for that topic.

** Browse GitHub Inbox
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:forge-extras-browse-github-inbox
:END:

#+findex: forge-extras-browse-github-inbox
The command ~forge-extras-browse-github-inbox~ opens the GitHub notifications page (https://github.com/notifications) in the default browser using =browse-url=.

** Toggle Issue/PR State (DWIM)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:forge-extras-state-set-dwim
:END:

#+findex: forge-extras-state-set-dwim
The command ~forge-extras-state-set-dwim~ toggles the state of the Forge issue or pull request at point (or the one associated with the current buffer). If the topic is currently 'open', it attempts to close it (set state to 'completed'). If it's 'completed', it attempts to reopen it (set state to 'open'). It uses the internal ~forge--set-topic-state~ function.

** Track Repository in Forge
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:forge-extras-track-repository
:END:

#+findex: forge-extras-track-repository
The command ~forge-extras-track-repository~ adds the Git repository in the specified directory (DIR, defaults to current directory) to the Forge database. It first checks if the directory is a valid Git repository. If so, it retrieves the remote URL, ensures the repository is known to Forge (inserting it if necessary using ~forge-get-repository~ with =:insert!=), pulls all topics (issues, PRs) for that repository using ~forge--pull~, and finally refreshes the Magit status buffer for the directory.

** Navigate Messages in Topic Buffer
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:navigate-messages
:END:

#+findex: forge-next-message
The command ~forge-next-message~ moves the point to the start of the next post (message) section within the current Forge topic buffer. If already on the last post, it messages "No next post". If not currently on a post section, it moves to the first post.

#+findex: forge-previous-message
The command ~forge-previous-message~ moves the point to the start of the previous post (message) section within the current Forge topic buffer. If already on the first post, it messages "No prev post". If not currently on a post section, it moves to the last post.

** Copy Message at Point
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:forge-extras-copy-message-at-point-as-kill
:END:

#+findex: forge-extras-copy-message-at-point-as-kill
The command ~forge-extras-copy-message-at-point-as-kill~ copies the body text of the Forge post section at point to the Emacs kill ring, preserving its formatting.

** Set GitHub Project Status
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:forge-extras-set-project-status
:END:

#+findex: forge-extras-set-project-status
The command ~forge-extras-set-project-status~ allows you to set the status of the current Forge issue or pull request within a configured GitHub Project.
- It prompts for a status from a predefined list (configured via ~forge-extras-status-option-ids-alist~).
- If the issue is not already part of the target GitHub Project (configured by ~forge-extras-project-owner~ and ~forge-extras-project-number~), it will prompt the user whether to add it.
- The changes are made by interacting with the GitHub GraphQL API.
- After a successful update, if in a `forge-topic-mode` buffer, it attempts to refresh the topic.

This functionality relies on the `gh` command-line tool being installed and authenticated.

** Set GitHub Project Estimate
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:forge-extras-set-project-estimate
:END:

#+findex: forge-extras-set-project-estimate
The command ~forge-extras-set-project-estimate~ allows you to set a numerical estimate for the current Forge issue or pull request within a configured GitHub Project.
- It prompts for a number (e.g., story points, hours). The current estimate, if available from a field named "Estimate", is offered as the default.
- It uses the GitHub Project configured by ~forge-extras-project-owner~ and ~forge-extras-project-number~.
- The specific "Estimate" field to update is identified by its Node ID stored in ~forge-extras-estimate-field-node-id~.
- If the issue is not already part of the target GitHub Project, it will prompt the user whether to add it.
- The changes are made by interacting with the GitHub GraphQL API.
- After a successful update, if in a `forge-topic-mode` buffer, it attempts to refresh the topic.

This functionality relies on the `gh` command-line tool being installed and authenticated, and requires ~forge-extras-estimate-field-node-id~ to be correctly configured.

** Get GitHub Project Field IDs
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:forge-extras-get-project-field-ids
:END:

#+findex: forge-extras-get-project-field-ids
The command ~forge-extras-get-project-field-ids~ fetches and displays all field names and their Node IDs for the GitHub Project configured via ~forge-extras-project-node-id~.
- It requires ~forge-extras-project-node-id~ to be set beforehand.
- The results are displayed in a new buffer named =*GitHub Project Fields*=.
- This command is crucial for finding the correct Node IDs to set for ~forge-extras-status-field-node-id~ and ~forge-extras-estimate-field-node-id~.
- It relies on the `gh` command-line tool being installed and authenticated.

* Customization
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:customization
:END:

=forge-extras.el= offers several customization options, primarily for the GitHub Project integration features. These are typically set using Emacs' M-x customize-group RET forge-extras-projects RET.

*** Setup for GitHub Project Integration
To use the GitHub Project integration features like setting status or estimate, you need to configure a few variables:
1. *Find your Project's Node ID*:
   - Go to your GitHub Project (e.g., https://github.com/orgs/YOUR_ORG/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER).
   - The Project's Node ID is not directly visible in the URL for "Projects (beta)" or "ProjectsV2".
   - One way to get it is using the `gh` CLI:
     #+begin_src sh
     gh api graphql -f query='query{organization(login: "YOUR_ORG"){projectV2(number: YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER){id}}}'
     #+end_src
     Replace =YOUR_ORG= and =YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER=. For a user-owned project, replace =organization(login: "YOUR_ORG")= with =user(login: "YOUR_USER"){projectV2...}=.
   - Set ~forge-extras-project-node-id~ to this ID.
2. *Find Field Node IDs*:
   - Once ~forge-extras-project-node-id~ is set, run ~M-x forge-extras-get-project-field-ids~.
   - This command will display a list of all fields in your project with their names and Node IDs in the =*GitHub Project Fields*= buffer.
3. *Configure Field IDs*:
   - From the output of ~forge-extras-get-project-field-ids~:
     - Find the Node ID for your "Status" field and set ~forge-extras-status-field-node-id~ to it.
     - Find the Node ID for your "Estimate" field (or equivalent numeric field) and set ~forge-extras-estimate-field-node-id~ to it.
4. *Configure Status Options* (for ~forge-extras-set-project-status~):
   - For the "Status" field, you also need the Option IDs for each status choice (e.g., "Todo", "In Progress", "Done").
   - These are not directly provided by ~forge-extras-get-project-field-ids~.
   - You can find these using GitHub's API explorer or by inspecting network requests in your browser when changing a status in the GitHub UI.
   - Populate ~forge-extras-status-option-ids-alist~ with these mappings.

You can set these variables using ~M-x customize-group RET forge-extras-projects RET~ or directly in your Emacs configuration file.

*** Custom Variables

+ ~forge-extras-project-owner~: The GitHub owner (organization or user) for the target project (default: "tlon-team"). This is used by some functions but ~forge-extras-project-node-id~ is generally preferred for newer project features.
#+vindex: forge-extras-project-owner
+ ~forge-extras-project-number~: The GitHub Project number (default: 9). This is used by some functions but ~forge-extras-project-node-id~ is generally preferred for newer project features.
#+vindex: forge-extras-project-number
+ ~forge-extras-project-node-id~: The GraphQL Node ID of the target GitHub Project. This is essential for most project-related commands. See the setup guide above for how to obtain this.
#+vindex: forge-extras-project-node-id
+ ~forge-extras-estimate-field-node-id~: The GraphQL Node ID of the "Estimate" (or equivalent numeric) field within the target project. This must be configured by the user. Use ~M-x forge-extras-get-project-field-ids~ to find the correct ID after setting ~forge-extras-project-node-id~.
#+vindex: forge-extras-estimate-field-node-id
+ ~forge-extras-status-field-node-id~: The GraphQL Node ID of the "Status" field within the target project. Use ~M-x forge-extras-get-project-field-ids~ to find the correct ID after setting ~forge-extras-project-node-id~.
#+vindex: forge-extras-status-field-node-id
+ ~forge-extras-status-option-ids-alist~: An alist mapping human-readable status names (e.g., "Doing", "Next") to their corresponding GraphQL Option IDs for the "Status" field in the target project. This list is used for prompting the user. Finding these Option IDs requires manual API inspection (see setup guide).
#+vindex: forge-extras-status-option-ids-alist

* Enhanced Functionality
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:enhanced-functionality
:END:

** Automatic Notification Pulling
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:forge-extras-pull-notifications
:END:

#+findex: forge-extras-pull-notifications
The function ~forge-extras-pull-notifications~ calls the standard ~forge-pull-notifications~ command, but wraps it in ~shut-up~ and ~with-no-warnings~ to suppress output. It also includes a check to prevent running if Elfeed updates are in progress (using the variable =elfeed-extras-auto-update-in-process=, presumably defined elsewhere), as this was found to cause issues. This function might be intended for use in timers or hooks for automatic background updates.

** Sync Read Status with GitHub (macOS Safari)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:forge-extras-sync-read-status
:END:

#+findex: forge-extras-sync-read-status
The function ~forge-extras-sync-read-status~ attempts to mark a Forge notification as read on GitHub by briefly opening its URL in Safari (macOS only). It only proceeds if the issue/PR at point currently has an 'unread' status in Forge.

It works by:
1. Getting the URL of the issue/PR at point.
2. Constructing an AppleScript command (using ~forge-extras-safari-script-format-string~) that tells Safari to open the URL in a new tab, wait briefly (5 seconds), attempt to check the document's `readyState` using JavaScript, and then close the tab if loading seems complete.
3. Executing this AppleScript asynchronously using ~forge-extras-async-shell-command-to-string~.
4. When the script finishes, it calls the callback ~forge-extras-update-github-counter~.

#+findex: forge-extras-update-github-counter
The callback function ~forge-extras-update-github-counter~ first checks if the AppleScript output indicates a problem with JavaScript execution in Safari (using ~forge-extras-safari-ensure-javascript-enabled~). If JavaScript seems okay, it then triggers an update of the GitHub notification count in Doom Modeline (if active) by calling ~doom-modeline--github-fetch-notifications~.

*Caveats:* This synchronization mechanism is macOS-specific, relies on AppleScript and Safari's ability to execute JavaScript from Apple Events (which needs to be enabled in Safari's Developer menu), and uses a fixed delay which might not always be sufficient for the page to load and GitHub to register the "read". It also requires the user to be logged into GitHub in Safari.

* Internal Functions (for reference)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:internal-functions
:END:

+ ~forge--goto-message~: Core logic for navigating between posts, used by ~forge-next-message~ and ~forge-previous-message~.
+ ~forge-extras-track-repo-all-topics~: Helper function to add/update a repository in Forge and pull all its topics.
+ ~forge-extras-async-shell-command-to-string~: Executes a shell command asynchronously and calls a callback with the output.
+ ~forge-extras-safari-github-logged-in-p~: Checks if the user appears logged into GitHub in Safari by checking the Safari window title (heuristic).
+ ~forge-extras-safari-ensure-javascript-enabled~: Checks AppleScript output for errors related to JavaScript execution permissions in Safari.
