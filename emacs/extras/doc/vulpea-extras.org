This manual describes the features and customization options for the Emacs Lisp file =vulpea-extras.el=.

* Overview
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:overview
:END:

=vulpea-extras.el= provides extensions for the =vulpea= package, which enhances note-taking workflows, particularly with Org Roam. These extensions focus on automatically identifying "project" files based on their content (TODO items, scheduled tasks, deadlines, anniversaries) and managing the =org-agenda-files= list accordingly.

The main features include:

+ Automatically detecting if an Org Roam note qualifies as a "project" file.
+ Automatically adding or removing a "project" tag to files based on their status.
+ Dynamically updating =org-agenda-files= to include project files and recently modified notes before the agenda is generated.
+ Customizable exclusion lists for directories and specific files.

* Configuration Variables
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:configuration-variables
:END:

These variables allow customization of which files are considered for project status and inclusion in the agenda.

** ~vulpea-extras-excluded-directories~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:vulpea-extras-excluded-directories
:END:

#+vindex: vulpea-extras-excluded-directories
A list of directory paths. Org files within these directories will be ignored by ~vulpea-extras-project-p~ and thus will not be automatically tagged as projects or necessarily included in the agenda based on project status.

** ~vulpea-extras-excluded-files~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:vulpea-extras-excluded-files
:END:

#+vindex: vulpea-extras-excluded-files
A list of specific file paths. These files will be ignored by ~vulpea-extras-project-p~, similar to files in excluded directories.

* Configuration Functions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:configuration-functions
:END:

These functions are designed to be used in hooks or advice to automate the project tagging and agenda file management.

** Update Project Tag
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:vulpea-extras-project-update-tag
:END:

#+findex: vulpea-extras-project-update-tag
The function ~vulpea-extras-project-update-tag~ checks if the current buffer qualifies as a project (using ~vulpea-extras-project-p~ or ~vulpea-extras-anniversary-p~) and adds or removes the "project" tag accordingly using =vulpea-buffer-tags-set=. It ensures tags are unique and only modifies the tags if a change is needed. This function is typically added to a hook, such as ~after-save-hook~, for Org Roam files.

** Update Org Agenda Files
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:vulpea-extras-agenda-files-update
:END:

#+findex: vulpea-extras-agenda-files-update
The function ~vulpea-extras-agenda-files-update~ dynamically updates the global variable =org-agenda-files= before the agenda is generated. It adds:
1. Files currently in =org-agenda-files=.
2. Files identified as projects via the "project" tag (queried using ~vulpea-extras-project-files~).
3. Recently modified Org Roam files (using ~org-roam-extras-recent~, limited by days and count).
It then removes duplicates and any files listed in the user-defined variable =org-extras-agenda-files-excluded=. This function is added as `:before` advice to the =org-agenda= command.

* Helper Functions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:helper-functions
:END:

These functions provide the core logic used by the configuration functions.

+ ~vulpea-extras-project-p~: Determines if the current Org mode buffer represents a project. It returns non-nil if the buffer contains at least one headline that:
  - Is not archived (does not have the "ARCHIVE" tag, respecting inheritance).
  - Is a TODO item (type 'todo').
  - OR is not DONE and has a SCHEDULED or DEADLINE property.
  It respects the ~vulpea-extras-excluded-directories~ and ~vulpea-extras-excluded-files~ variables.
+ ~vulpea-extras-anniversary-p~: Returns non-nil if the current Org mode buffer contains an Org anniversary expression (e.g., =%%(org-anniversary ...)=).
+ ~vulpea-extras-project-files~: Queries the Org Roam database to return a unique list of file paths that have the "project" tag associated with any node within them.
+ ~vulpea-extras-buffer-p~: Returns non-nil if the current buffer's file name is located within the =org-roam-directory=.

* Advised Functions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:advised-functions
:END:

** ~org-agenda~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:org-agenda-advice
:END:

#+findex: org-agenda
The standard =org-agenda= command is advised `:before` by ~vulpea-extras-agenda-files-update~. This ensures that the =org-agenda-files= list is up-to-date with project files and recent notes immediately before the agenda view is constructed.

* Indices
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:indices
:END:

** Function index
:PROPERTIES:
:INDEX: fn
:CUSTOM_ID: h:function-index
:END:

** Variable index
:PROPERTIES:
:INDEX: vr
:CUSTOM_ID: h:variable-index
:END:
