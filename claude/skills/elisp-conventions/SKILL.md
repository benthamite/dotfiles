- Write atomic, focused functions. When tempted to add a comment explaining code, refactor it into a function with a clear intention, so that the comment is no longer necessary. Functions should generally be only a few lines long.
- Never insert empty lines within a function.
- Put helper functions *after* the function that calls them, not before.
- Docstrings should document all arguments, capitalized.
- Fill all docstrings to 80 characters.
- The first line of the docstring should be a single-sentence summary.
- When writing multiline docstrings, do not leave a newline between the first and second lines. But do leave a newline between all successive paragraphs.
- Do not end error messages with a period.
- Only add comments if truly necessary to understand the code. Avoid commenting every detail.
- Never create "fallbacks" to handle problems silently: always choose errors over silent unexpected behavior.
- Whenever possible, test things end-to-end. You can use emacsclient for this.
