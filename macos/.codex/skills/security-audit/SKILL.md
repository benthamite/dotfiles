# Security audit

Audit the development environment and explain the exposure each finding
establishes. Run all four domains by default, or select `--secrets`, `--deps`,
`--machine`, or `--agents`. Keep `--claude` as a compatibility selector for
the Claude-only portion of `--agents`.

An optional directory scopes secrets and dependency checks to that directory.
Without one, use the current directory plus relevant shell and agent
configuration locations. Machine checks concern the current Mac; agent checks
cover installed agents, their active account/profile configurations, and the
current project's overrides. State these roots before scanning; do not silently
expand into unrelated repositories or accounts.

Read the selected domain references completely before running their checks:

| Domain | Required reference |
|---|---|
| Secrets and credential incidents | [secrets](references/secrets.md) |
| Dependencies and other executable supply chains | [supply chain](references/supply-chain.md) |
| macOS controls, isolation, and recovery | [machine](references/machine.md) |
| Claude, Codex, MCP, plugins, and browser automation | [agents](references/agents.md) |

Independent domains may use subagents. Give each the resolved scope, relevant
reference, and all safety boundaries below. Deduplicate findings that cross
domains.

## Safety boundaries

An audit is read-only unless the user authorizes remediation. Do not rotate
credentials, change settings, install audit dependencies, resolve/build project
dependencies, activate project code, or mutate accounts while auditing.
Authorized remediation remains limited to the requested targets and actions.

Preserve the owner's guard policy. Repairing enforcement of an existing rule
does not authorize changing what the rule permits. A different rule requires
an explicit decision on that proposed policy; existing authorization for the
same change suffices. In Pablo's configuration, guards must allow or deny,
never introduce interactive approval prompts.

Before credential-related work, read
`~/My Drive/dotfiles/claude/context/secrets.md`. Use its personal/Epoch
placement and broker rules; this skill does not redefine them. For service
access use `claude/context/service-access.md`; for MCP placement use
`claude/context/mcp-servers.md`, resolved under that dotfiles root.

Never emit matching secret values or raw config/history lines. Use an approved
local scanner or metadata-only helper that reports path, line, type, and a
keyed fingerprint when necessary. Do not open vault contents, private keys,
browser cookies/session databases, or credential files for content inspection.
The bundled shell classifier supplies value-free output for shell-file reads
permitted by the guard; other checks must stay within the existing read policy. A
metadata-only output is not permission to bypass a denied input read.
Do not source a target shell file, load an editor config, run `direnv allow`,
start an MCP server, or execute a project-supplied scanner to inspect it.

Inspect a check's execution, output, and network effects before running it.
Capture and filter potentially sensitive stdout **and stderr** locally before
tool output reaches the transcript. Do not send secrets, config files, or
private dependency metadata to a remote scanner; verify the destination and
data scope for advisory queries. Temporary sanitized artifacts must be private,
outside Drive, and cleaned up. Mark unavailable, unsafe, denied, or unsupported
checks as not checked, with the concrete reason. Do not weaken a guard to
complete a check.

## Threat model and evidence

Assume a dependency or agent workflow could execute malicious code. Assess
which files, authenticated services, devices, and credentials that process can
reach, and how the owner would recover. Consider credential theft/phishing,
physical loss, persistence, and prompt injection where relevant.

OS permissions and actual sandbox/VM boundaries constrain processes. A browser
profile separates browser state; it does not protect another profile from
malware running as the same OS user. A VM application's presence does not
establish isolation. Per-process secret injection reduces inheritance but still
exposes the injected values to that process and its descendants. Encryption at
rest does not establish protection while data is unlocked.

Distinguish a configured control from an observed effective control. Use safe
synthetic fixtures to verify a guard's decisions or isolation behavior when
needed; never probe with actual credentials or destructive actions. Do not
equate installed tools, hook counts, famous publishers, or a scanner's silence
with security. Keep an unverified claim explicitly unverified.

## Report

Give a compact coverage table per selected domain: checked (with or without a
finding), not checked (reason), or not applicable (reason). Identify roots,
tool versions, and reference dates only where they affect the conclusion.
Track skipped subchecks so a partial scan cannot look complete.

For each deduplicated finding include location, observed evidence, confidence,
the concrete exposure and affected workflow, severity rationale, and a scoped
remedy. Separate findings from optional hardening and unresolved questions.

- Critical: evidence of an immediately consequential exposure, such as a
  currently usable credential exposed publicly or active compromise.
- High: an established, substantial access or execution path to sensitive assets.
- Medium: a material control gap with a plausible but constrained exposure.
- Low: optional hardening or limited-impact gaps.

A scanner match is a candidate until classified; do not test a credential's
live validity without authorization. Advisory severity, local exposure,
confidence, and fix availability are separate facts. Keep relevant unfixed
transitive and dev-tool vulnerabilities visible; no upgrade path does not
remove the risk. Do not label a whole domain safe when consequential checks
were unavailable.

End with the material risk and coverage limits, plus prioritized do/skip/defer
recommendations. If remediation was authorized, perform it within that scope
and verify the reported behavior before claiming it resolved.
