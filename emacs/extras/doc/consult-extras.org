This manual describes the features and customization options for the Emacs Lisp file =consult-extras.el=.

* Overview
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:overview
:END:

=consult-extras.el= provides extensions for the =consult= package, which offers enhanced searching and previewing capabilities within Emacs. These extensions add specialized search commands and integrate =consult= with Org mode headings.

The main features include:

+ A command to toggle multiline searching for =consult-ripgrep=.
+ Commands to run =consult-locate= scoped to the current directory, optionally matching only file names.
+ A command to run =consult-ripgrep= scoped to the current directory.
+ An enhanced command to jump to Org headings using =consult-org-heading= with automatic widening and unfolding.

* Commands
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:commands
:END:

=consult-extras.el= provides the following interactive commands:

** Toggle Multiline Ripgrep Search
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:consult-extras-toggle-multiline
:END:

#+findex: consult-extras-toggle-multiline
The command ~consult-extras-toggle-multiline~ toggles the multiline search flags (=--multiline --multiline-dotall=) for =consult-ripgrep=. It modifies the ~consult-ripgrep-args~ variable by appending or removing these flags. This allows users to quickly switch between single-line and multiline searching when using =consult-ripgrep=.

** Locate Files in Current Directory
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:consult-extras-locate-current
:END:

#+findex: consult-extras-locate-current
The command ~consult-extras-locate-current~ runs =consult-locate= but restricts the search scope to the current directory (=default-directory=). It achieves this by temporarily setting ~consult-locate-args~ to use =mdfind-wrapper= (presumably a custom script) with the =-onlyin= option pointing to the current directory.

** Locate File Names in Current Directory
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:consult-extras-locate-file-current
:END:

#+findex: consult-extras-locate-file-current
Similar to ~consult-extras-locate-current~, this command runs =consult-locate= restricted to the current directory. However, it also adds the =-name= flag to =mdfind-wrapper=, instructing it to match only against file names, not their contents.

** Ripgrep in Current Directory
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:consult-extras-ripgrep-current
:END:

#+findex: consult-extras-ripgrep-current
The command ~consult-extras-ripgrep-current~ provides a shortcut to run =consult-ripgrep= specifically within the current directory (=default-directory=).

** Enhanced Org Heading Jump
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:consult-extras-org-heading
:END:

#+findex: consult-extras-org-heading
The command ~consult-extras-org-heading~ enhances the standard =consult-org-heading= command. Before calling =consult-org-heading=, it ensures the buffer is widened (using =widen=) and all headings are unfolded (using ~org-extras-fold-show-all-headings~). After the jump, it recenters the view. This provides a more consistent experience when jumping to Org headings, ensuring the target heading is always visible. It accepts the same optional MATCH and SCOPE arguments as =consult-org-heading=.

* Indices
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:indices
:END:

** Function index
:PROPERTIES:
:INDEX: fn
:CUSTOM_ID: h:function-index
:END:

** Variable index
:PROPERTIES:
:INDEX: vr
:CUSTOM_ID: h:variable-index
:END:
