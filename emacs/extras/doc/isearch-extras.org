This manual describes the features and customization options for the Emacs Lisp file =isearch-extras.el=.

* Overview
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:overview
:END:

=isearch-extras.el= provides extensions for Emacs' built-in incremental search facility (=isearch.el=). These extensions add new actions available during an active search, modify how searches are initiated, and integrate isearch with other tools like =consult= and =project=.

The main features include:

- Commands to exit isearch at the opposite end of the match or copy the current match to the kill ring.
- A command to yank text from the kill ring literally into the search string.
- Advice to automatically use the active region as the initial search string.
- Integration commands to transfer the current search term to =consult-line= or =project-find-regexp=.

* Commands Available During Isearch
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:commands-during-isearch
:END:

These commands are intended to be bound to keys within the =isearch-mode-map=.

** Exit Isearch at Other End
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:isearch-extras-exit-other-end
:END:

#+findex: isearch-extras-exit-other-end
The command ~isearch-extras-exit-other-end~ exits the current incremental search (using =isearch-exit=) and then moves the point to the opposite end of the last match found (using the value stored in =isearch-other-end=).

** Copy Isearch Match
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:isearch-extras-copy-match
:END:

#+findex: isearch-extras-copy-match
The command ~isearch-extras-copy-match~ copies the text of the current isearch match (from point to =isearch-other-end=) to the kill ring using =kill-new= and then exits the search using =isearch-done=.

** Yank Kill Literally
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:isearch-extras-yank-kill-literally
:END:

#+findex: isearch-extras-yank-kill-literally
The command ~isearch-extras-yank-kill-literally~ inserts the text from the kill ring (the most recent kill) directly into the isearch prompt *without* interpreting any special characters (like regexp metacharacters). This differs from the standard isearch yank command (=M-y=) which might interpret the yanked text.

** Transfer Search to Consult Line
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:isearch-extras-consult-line
:END:

#+findex: isearch-extras-consult-line
The command ~isearch-extras-consult-line~ takes the current isearch string, updates the isearch ring, exits the isearch session, and then immediately starts =consult-line= using the same search string (properly quoted if it wasn't already a regexp). This allows seamlessly switching from an in-buffer isearch to a =consult= interface for the same query. Requires the =consult= package.

** Transfer Search to Project Search
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:isearch-extras-project-search
:END:

#+findex: isearch-extras-project-search
The command ~isearch-extras-project-search~ takes the current isearch string, updates the isearch ring, exits the isearch session, and then immediately starts =project-find-regexp= using the same search string (properly quoted if it wasn't already a regexp). This allows easily escalating an in-buffer search to a project-wide search. Requires Emacs' built-in =project= library.

* Enhanced Functionality
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:enhanced-functionality
:END:

** Use Active Region for Initial Search
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:isearch-extras-use-selection
:END:

#+findex: isearch-extras-use-selection
The function ~isearch-extras-use-selection~ is designed to be added as =:around= advice to isearch commands like =isearch-forward= and =isearch-backward=.

If a region is active when the advised isearch command is invoked, this function:
1. Takes the text within the active region.
2. Adds this text to the isearch ring (=isearch-update-ring=).
3. Deactivates the mark.
4. Calls the original isearch command.
5. Immediately repeats the search in the appropriate direction (forward or backward) to find the first occurrence of the selected text.

If no region is active, it simply calls the original isearch command as usual. This provides a convenient way to start searching for the currently selected text.

* Indices
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:indices
:END:

** Function index
:PROPERTIES:
:INDEX: fn
:CUSTOM_ID: h:function-index
:END:

** Variable index
:PROPERTIES:
:INDEX: vr
:CUSTOM_ID: h:variable-index
:END:
