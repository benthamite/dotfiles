Hi $1,

Together with [[https://matthewvandermerwe.com/][Matthew van der Merwe]], I run /[[https://futurematters.news/][Future Matters]]/, a newsletter about longtermism.

Each issue includes a "conversation" with an expert on a topic relevant from a longtermist perspective. So far, we've had conversations with John Halstead, Petra Kosonen, Rob Long, Ben Snodin and Nick Beckstead. Matthew and I have been reading your recent work on $2 with great interest, and we'd be excited to discuss some of these writings with you, especially $3.

Would you have time for a 20-minute Zoom/Meet call next week? Alternatively, we could conduct the interview by email if you prefer. (If we do it as a call, we'll send you the transcript for your approval before publishing it, and you are welcome to introduce as many changes as you see fit.)

All the best,$0
