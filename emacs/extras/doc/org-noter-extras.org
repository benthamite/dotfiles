This manual describes the features and customization options for the Emacs Lisp file =org-noter-extras.el=.

* Overview
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:overview
:END:

=org-noter-extras.el= provides extensions for the =org-noter= package, which facilitates taking notes on PDF documents within Org mode. These extensions focus on cleaning up annotations, managing hyphenation in extracted text, adjusting page number offsets, and improving navigation.

The main features include:

+ A command to clean up newly created highlight annotations, replacing the generic heading with a custom title and quoting the extracted text.
+ A command to append the content of the current annotation to the previous one.
+ Functions to remove leftover hyphens from text extracted from PDFs.
+ A command to adjust page numbers in annotation headings based on a calculated offset between PDF pages and book/article pages.
+ Commands to navigate between notes without switching focus to the PDF buffer.

* Variables
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:variables
:END:

** ~org-noter-extras-dehyphenate-hyphens~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:org-noter-extras-dehyphenate-hyphens
:END:

#+vindex: org-noter-extras-dehyphenate-hyphens
A list of strings representing hyphen characters that should be removed by the ~org-noter-extras-dehyphenate~ function when cleaning up extracted text. Defaults to `("-" "¬")`.

** ~org-noter-highlight-heading-regexp~
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:org-noter-highlight-heading-regexp
:END:

#+vindex: org-noter-highlight-heading-regexp
A regular expression used to identify the default heading format created by `org-noter` for highlight annotations ("Highlight on page X"). Used by ~org-noter-extras-cleanup-annotation~ and ~org-noter-get-annotation-contents~. Defaults to `"Highlight on page \\(.*\\)"`.

* Commands
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:commands
:END:

=org-noter-extras.el= provides the following interactive commands, typically used within an Org Noter notes buffer:

** Cleanup Annotation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:org-noter-extras-cleanup-annotation
:END:

#+findex: org-noter-extras-cleanup-annotation
The command ~org-noter-extras-cleanup-annotation~ refines a newly created Org Noter highlight annotation.
1. It synchronizes the current note position.
2. Switches to the Org notes buffer.
3. Prompts the user for a custom TITLE for the annotation.
4. Extracts the text content of the annotation using ~org-noter-get-annotation-contents~.
5. Cuts the original annotation subtree.
6. Moves to the previous heading (which should be the generic "Highlight on page X" heading).
7. Extracts the page number (X) from the generic heading.
8. Edits the heading to use the custom TITLE provided by the user and the extracted page number (formatted as "TITLE, p. X").
9. Narrows to the updated heading's subtree.
10. Inserts the extracted annotation content, wrapped in an Org quote block (`#+begin_quote ... #+end_quote`).
11. Cleans up potential extra newlines.
12. Moves to the next heading and unfolds the modified subtree.

** Append Annotation to Previous
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:org-noter-extras-append-to-previous-annotation
:END:

#+findex: org-noter-extras-append-to-previous-annotation
The command ~org-noter-extras-append-to-previous-annotation~ merges the content of the current annotation note into the previous one.
1. It extracts the text content of the current annotation using ~org-noter-get-annotation-contents~.
2. It cuts the current annotation subtree.
3. It searches backward for the end of the previous annotation's quote block (`#+end_quote`).
4. It inserts the extracted content just before the `#+end_quote` marker of the previous annotation, effectively appending it.

** Dehyphenate Text
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:org-noter-extras-dehyphenate
:END:

#+findex: org-noter-extras-dehyphenate
The command ~org-noter-extras-dehyphenate~ removes leftover hyphens that often occur at line breaks when text is extracted from PDFs. It operates on the current paragraph, or the active region if one exists. It searches for patterns like `[alpha]<hyphen> [alpha]` (where `<hyphen>` is one of the characters in ~org-noter-extras-dehyphenate-hyphens~) and replaces them with `[alpha][alpha]`, effectively joining the hyphenated word parts. This command might be intended to be run automatically via a hook (see TODO in source code).

** Apply Highlight Page Offset
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:org-noter-extras-highlight-offset
:END:

#+findex: org-noter-extras-highlight-offset
The command ~org-noter-extras-highlight-offset~ adjusts the page numbers recorded in "Highlight on page X" headings throughout the buffer. It prompts the user for an OFFSET value, which represents the difference between the PDF page number shown in the viewer and the actual page number printed in the book or article (OFFSET = PDF Page - Book Page). It then searches for all highlight headings, extracts the page number (X), subtracts the OFFSET, and replaces the heading with the adjusted page number.

** Set Hyphen Character for Dehyphenation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:org-noter-extras-set-hyphen
:END:

#+findex: org-noter-extras-set-hyphen
The command ~org-noter-extras-set-hyphen~ allows the user to interactively change the list of hyphen characters used by ~org-noter-extras-dehyphenate~. It prompts the user to select from predefined options ("-" or "­") and updates the ~org-noter-extras-dehyphenate-hyphens~ variable accordingly.

** Sync Next/Previous Note (No Focus Change)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:sync-no-focus-change
:END:

#+findex: org-noter-extras-sync-next-note
The command ~org-noter-extras-sync-next-note~ calls the standard =org-noter-sync-next-note= but immediately switches focus back to the Org notes window using `other-window 1`. This prevents the default behavior of shifting focus to the PDF document buffer.

#+findex: org-noter-extras-sync-prev-note
The command ~org-noter-extras-sync-prev-note~ calls the standard =org-noter-sync-prev-note= but immediately switches focus back to the Org notes window using `other-window 1`.

* Helper Functions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:helper-functions
:END:

** Get Annotation Contents
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:org-noter-get-annotation-contents
:END:

#+findex: org-noter-get-annotation-contents
The function ~org-noter-get-annotation-contents~ extracts and cleans the text content from the current Org Noter annotation subtree. It handles finding the start of the content (after metadata or the "Contents" heading), narrows to the content region, fills the text to remove excessive line breaks (using a very large `fill-column`), runs ~org-noter-extras-dehyphenate~ to fix hyphenation, and returns the cleaned text.

* Indices
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:indices
:END:

** Function index
:PROPERTIES:
:INDEX: fn
:CUSTOM_ID: h:function-index
:END:

** Variable index
:PROPERTIES:
:INDEX: vr
:CUSTOM_ID: h:variable-index
:END:
